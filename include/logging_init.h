/**
 * @brief Decide whether the console sink should be attached
 *
 * Pure function (no spdlog/isatty/fstat dependency) so the gate is unit-testable
 * without a real TTY. Called by init() with the already-resolved target and the
 * stdout kind from classify_stdout().
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Console target: console is the ONLY sink, always add.
 *   - Android target: stdout is invisible (logcat handles output), never add.
 *   - Journal/Syslog/File: a structured destination already captures output.
 *     Add the console when stdout is a TTY (interactive run from a shell), so
 *     dev workstations and `ssh -t` sessions still see colored output.
 *
 *     `force_console` (an explicit -v/--log-level) additionally attaches the
 *     console when stdout is a PIPE, but deliberately NOT when it is a regular
 *     file or a socket:
 *
 *       - A pipe means a human is watching through `tee`/`grep` — the documented
 *         way to capture a session — so the output must not be discarded (#1105).
 *       - A regular file is the daemon redirect (`>> $LOGFILE 2>&1` in the
 *         U1/K1/K2/CC1/AD5M init scripts) and a socket is systemd's
 *         StandardOutput=journal. In both cases stdout already lands in the same
 *         place the structured sink writes, so a console sink double-logs every
 *         line. That is not hypothetical: it caused the Snapmaker U1 tmpfs
 *         blowout where /tmp/helixscreen.log grew to 498 MB at trace level, and
 *         the shipped launcher DOES synthesize --log-level/-vv from the
 *         HELIX_LOG_LEVEL / HELIX_DEBUG env vars (scripts/helix-launcher.sh),
 *         which serve-local-update.sh writes onto live devices — so force_console
 *         is reachable under systemd and must stay off for file/socket.
 *
 *   - test_mode (--test) attaches the console for ANY stdout kind, including a
 *     regular file or socket. This is safe precisely because --test never runs
 *     in production: no systemd unit, init script, procd shim, or launcher
 *     passes it, so test mode cannot reach a daemonized double-log path. It
 *     closes the gap left by the pipe-only force — issue #1105's literal repro
 *     is `helix-screen --test -vv`, and a reporter redirecting with `> file`
 *     rather than `| tee` would otherwise still see nothing.
 *
 *     Deliberate precedence: test_mode does NOT override the Android rule.
 *     Android + test mode is not a real configuration, and stdout is invisible
 *     under logcat either way, so Android keeps returning false.
 *
 *     Accepted tradeoff (production only): `helix-screen -vv > out.log` stays
 *     silent, because a plain redirect is indistinguishable from the daemon
 *     redirect. Unchanged from previous behavior, so not a regression; use
 *     `| tee out.log` instead.
 *   - enable_console is the master switch and vetoes every case.
