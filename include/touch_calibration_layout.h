/**
 * @file touch_calibration_layout.h
 * @brief Shared full-screen capture-surface layout helpers for touch calibration.
 *
 * Both the first-run wizard (WizardTouchCalibrationStep) and the Settings
 * recalibration overlay (TouchCalibrationOverlay) capture raw touch points with
 * the affine transform disabled. For that capture to work the invisible touch
 * surface (and the crosshair that marks each target) must cover the ENTIRE screen
 * — including any header/chrome — otherwise an uncalibrated tap on a top-edge
 * target reports a coordinate that lands in the header strip, where a clickable
 * control (e.g. the header Back button) absorbs the press.
 *
 * These free functions factor out the reparent-to-screen logic the two callers
 * previously duplicated, plus a small "lift a control above the capture surface"
 * helper used to keep an escape affordance (Next/Skip group, Cancel chip)
 * clickable while the full-screen capture surface is armed.
